A string is just a string of characters.
It should be surrounded by double quotes.

- Integer
large numbers put _ in between the thousands.                        569_945_301

- Float
Decimals                                                               3.14159     

- Boolean
True of False

- When divide a number we will have a                                 print(9 // 5)
floating point number                                                      4

-type()                          check whatever you put between the parentheses and give you the type of data that it is 
                                                    print(type(variable))

-String Concatenation                                                  "Hello" + "Hi"                 
You can add strings to string to create                                #becomes HelloHi
a new string. This is called concatenation.
It results in a new string.

-Print the lenght of string                                          variable = input("What is your name?\n")
                                                                     print(len(variable))
                                                                        int, str, etc

do type conversion or casting 
change a piece of data from one particular data type to another.          variable_int = len(input("type any number"))
                                                                          change_variable_to_float = float(variable_int)
                                                                          print("The number has " + change_variable_to_float + " characters")     


- Variables
A variable give a name to a piece of data.                            name = "Bob" 
Like a box with a label, it tells you what's                          age = 345
inside the box. You can refer everytime in your
code.


- Index
[]
the square brackets, we can put the index or                            print("Bloob"[1])
the position of the character that we want                              l
this method of pulling out a particular element 
from a string is called sub-scripting


-When writing code it is common to manipulate                             value = 0 
a value based on its previous value
This is a convient way of saying: "take the
previous value and add to it.                                             value += 1   #could be value = value + 1
could be  value -=1, value *=1, value /=1


- F-Strings
You can insert a variable into a string using f-strings                          days = 365
The syntax is simple, just insert the variable                                print(f"There are {days} in a year")
in-between a set of curly braces {}.
days = 365
print(f"There are {days}
in a year"

- IF/ELSE/ELIF                                                                 if conditiona 1:
 conditional statement                                                               do A
It is good to use a flow chart to get better idea                              elif condition 2:
                                                                                      do B
                                                                              else:
                                                                                      do this 
>=   Greater than or equal to                                                  
<=   Less than or equal to 
==   Equal precisely, Equality, checking to see if the value on the left is equal to the value on the right
=    Assign value
!=   Not Equal

- Modulo Operator 
you'll want to know what is the remainder after a division.
e.g. 4 รท 2 = 2 with no remainder but 5 รท 2 = 2 with 1 remainder. The modulo does not give you the result of the division, just the remainder.


- IF/ELSE - NESTED
in a nested if statement, once the first condition has passed,we can check for another condition. And then we can have another 
if/else statement inside this if condition
